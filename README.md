# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
This repository contains the run_analysis file with the R code, the codebook that describes this file, the tidy data set in .csv and .txt format and this README file.

- run_analysis.R is the code that performs the download, the tidying and the analysis of the original data, following the steps described by the homework assignment:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one single data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements of the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

- Codebook.md gives information on the structure, contents, and layout of the code file, so that others can understand each step in the analysis and cleaning of the data and run it without any issues.
- TidyDataSet.csv and TidyDataSet.txt are the different file versions of the final tidy data set that is requested in Step 5
